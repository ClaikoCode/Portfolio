# Portfolio

This portfolio was built using React + Vite + TypeScript and serves as a showcase for my projects. The portfolio itself is also its own project as I will be attempting to creating this portfolio not knowing any specifics around Vite, React, or Tailwind.

The goals for this project are:

* Have a free website that I have full control over and can host locally if I choose to do so in the future. 
* To challenge my general programming knowledge by seeing if I can adapt to an entirely different programming environment in a reasonable time (at a basic level). 

In todays day and age, we can make use of LLMs to tackle these kinds of challenges in an efficient way. It is essentially a perfect case for it:

1. Most LLMs understand basic web-dev code well and portfolio websites are very common projects for junior web-devs. 
2. I don't have much *practical* reason to learn a modern web-dev stack for my career which is in game development.
3. With todays AI tools, a simple website for a portfolio could most certainly be built if given a design document and some extra prompts for direction/adjustment.

Having all of this said, I will push myself to write all code myself and any prompts that will be used to get help from an LLM will be made to educate myself rather than to produce code that can be copied and pasted without thought. 

This is the perspective I have for all uses of modern AI. It is a *tool* that can be invaluable for guided personal learning, but too much reliance on its pure output will leave the brain as empty as when the first prompt was written.

I am not going completely blind into this. I have some prior practical Javascript and HTML knowledge from a course on "Games on the Web". I also had a small course on front-end web development almost 10 years ago (JQuery era), where I learned about how websites process JavaScript, what the DOM is, etc. As this is 10 years ago, I have forgotten almost all specifics but the general knowledge I gained from it might still prove to be useful in this project. I have no prior practical knowledge Vite, React, or Tailwind. I have only heard of them before.

## Development Log

There is a separate document that contains my development log for the project. This is mostly for myself but I chose to include it into the repo for two reasons. Firstly, it will give a bit of a push to actually write and document problems with solutions, which I want to do more of but always end up not doing. Lastly, it will show in which ways I learn and how I view problems to anyone that is interested.
